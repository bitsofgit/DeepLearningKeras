Rules of thumb for starting number of hidden layers
0           only represent linearly separable
1           continuous mapping from one finite space to another
2           can represent arbitray decision boundary
3 or more   additional layers can learn complex representations

Rules of thumb for number of neurons
>= size of input layer AND <= size of output layer
(2/3 * size of input layer) + size of output layer
<2 * size of input layer

Keras layers
    Groups
        Common
            Dense - each neuron is connected to every other layer
            Dropout - Sometimes data fits too nicely - that's called overfitting. Dropout layer is used to remove overfitting.
        Shaping
            Reshape 
            Flatten
            Permute
            RepeatVector
        Merging
            Add
            Subtract
            Multiply
            Average
            Maximum
            Concatenate
            Dot
        Extension
            For extending and custom tasks
            Lambda
            Custom
        Convolutional - separate module - for images
        Recurrent - separate module - for finding meaning of sentence
